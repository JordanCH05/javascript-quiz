    * Simple bee themed colourscheme chosen
    * Contrasting black and yellow colours for easy legibility and style

* Font
    * Font taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * Rajdhani used for legibility
    * Good for small texts as it is without serifs
    * Q looks like a round bee with a stinger

* Figma
    * Pages were planned out on [Figma](https://www.figma.com) using wireframes
